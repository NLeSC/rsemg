### Notebooks

Initial experiments:
- Ongoing


### Program files

The main program in this repository contains functions for analysis of EMG.


## Data sets

The notebooks are configured to run on various datasets.
Contact Candace Makeda Moore (c.moore@esciencecenter.nl) to discuss any questions on data configuration. 

## Getting started

How to get the notebooks running? Assuming the raw data set and metadata is available.

1. Install all Python packages required, using conda and the environment.yml file.
1a. The command can be something like: conda env create -f environment.yml
